## 👨‍⚕️ User Types
The following user types exist in the system:
- Doctor - they can manage availability and communicate with patients about appointments and respond to patient reviews. 
- Patient - can view information about doctor's office including schedule. They can also book appointments through the app and leave reviews 
- Admin - that manages the API and are responsible for adding new offices when they open up.

## 💥 Features

- As a Patient, I want to be able to schedule my appointments without dealing with the wait time associated with an indemand doctor. Rather than waiting for the office to communicate their schedule I can view it myself online and request an appointment. This will allow me to feel more control over my healthcare experience.
- As a health care professional, I want to be able to use BookfiyMD as a daily reference so I don’t have to store my schedule in my head and I can update my availability to on the fly given a pressing personal or professional concern. I look forward to v2 of BookifyMD when patient appointments are reinforced by email and text notifications to ensure they show up on time and can be informed of any updates to their booking.
- As a System manager, I would offer BookifyMD as a service to local care providers. Giving them the ability to abstract away patient scheduling from their day-to-day practices. Once on boarded I would refer their information to our database manager so their office information can be added and given credentials. From that point their individual practitioners could create an account and list their ability with the associated office.
